* Hashing

This repo contains the code written by a student for (hopefully) the International Bacculearte Computer Science Extended Essay.
It is used to investigate the performance metrics of different hash functions with real world data.
 
The paper will be linked soon.

** Building

The code is split between c++ code, which is used implement and test the hash functions, and the python code which is used for the build system and generating clean and professional graphs and statstics from the result data from the testing.

You can build it with the following commands:

```bash
meson build
meson compile -C build
```
and run tests with
```
meson test
```

(have fun)
